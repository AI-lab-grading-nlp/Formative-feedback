# Formative feedback 

## About the project
Experiments with localized versions of AI models to find fast short-answer response feedback methods.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ is required.

### Installation
Clone the repository.

'''git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git'''

## Usage

1. Add the question, the rubric, and a student's answer into the "prompt."
2. Run the model.
3. Observe the output: the model's feedback based on the information provided in the rubric.

## Roadmap

1. The project would assign feedback to a poll response using a large language model.
2. A technology that has been used so far is BigScience's BLOOM. 
3. Future directions would include experimenting with prompt engineering in BLOOM to develop accurate feedback and potentially combining the LLM with the classification model overviewed in the separate repository.
